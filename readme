Hi, MWDN Team

I decided to make Foreign Key relational instead of ManyToMany since itâ€™s easier to do mass creation of objects and the logic of the code is less complicated.
If this were a solution on the project or production, I would choose ManyToMany. Here I made this decision to optimise elapsed time.

I choose PyPDF2 library for parsing PDF documents as it is one of the most popular libraries which supports Python2 and has adequate documentation.
There were also other variants, but they support only Python 3.

I did exactly the get-all-urls and get-urls / <document_name> method, and not get-urls / and get-urls / <document_name> because these methods return a different data structure.
If they had the same structure, I would choose second option.

As far as I understand the 6th task, a self-written middleware will help in solving this problem, which returns False every time when the response status is not 200.



Examples:

Method: file-upload/
Return example:
    {"status": true, "data": {"urls_created": 0, "filename": "resume_2020.pdf"}}

Method: get-documents/
Return example:
    {"status": true, "data": [{"urls_count": 7, "document_name": "resume_update.pdf", "document_id": 4},
    {"urls_count": 5, "document_name": "resume_2020.pdf", "document_id": 3}]}

Method: get-urls/(?P<document_name>.+)/
        get-urls/resume_update.pdf/

Return example:
    {"status": true,
    "data": ["https://github.com/Geebz/Crypto_rr", "https://github.com/Geebz", "https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data/", "https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-databases/", "https://www.facebook.com/geebzi", "https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data/", "https://github.com/Geebz/evo-hellobob"]
    }

Method: get-all-urls/
Return example:
    {"status": true,
    "data": [{"url_name": "https://github.com/Geebz/evo-hellobob", "document_count": 1},
     {"url_name": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data/", "document_count": 2},
     {"url_name": "https://github.com/Geebz", "document_count": 2},
     {"url_name": "https://github.com/Geebz/Crypto_rr", "document_count": 1},
     {"url_name": "https://www.facebook.com/geebzi", "document_count": 2}]}
